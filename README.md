### Work done by damt
I've done a compelete recode of the entire system, including kits and all, I've made it more optimized and more complex and helps the server compete, I've organized the project and fixed up a lot of bugs! I've added the following so far:
* Complete Recode
* Kit System
* Profile System
* Added Full New Util System
* Added Command API and more!
### Information
This was an unfinished kit-pvp core made by damt for RefineDevelopment that was never completed and after his departure from the community, I think its wise to just open source this abandoned project. Please credit the original authors and don't try to re-sell this as your own.
